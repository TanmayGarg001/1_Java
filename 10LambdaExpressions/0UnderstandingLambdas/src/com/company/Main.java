//Lambda calculus (also written as Î»-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction
//and application using variable binding and substitution. It is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine.
//It was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics.

//A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are similar to methods,
//but they do not need a name, and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

    //Java before JAVA8 Launch was completely OOP language, but with lambda expressions in place it opens the door of functional programming.
    //Some major benefits of lambdas expressions are:-
    //Enables functional programming,readable and concise code,easier to use API's and libraries,Enables support for parallel processing!

    //We can pretty much do everything in Object-Oriented programming.So we don't really need functional programming
    //but the advantages of functional programming are very useful, think of it as a golden tool that java provides you.
