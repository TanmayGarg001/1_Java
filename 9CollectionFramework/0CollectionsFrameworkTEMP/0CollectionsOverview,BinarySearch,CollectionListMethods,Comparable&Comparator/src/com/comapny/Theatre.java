    //Comparable  = compareTo is used to compare something to another and return the values according to that.

    //Consider a Movie class that has members like, rating, name, year. Suppose we wish to sort a list of Movies based on year of release.
    //We can implement the Comparable interface with the Movie class, and we override the method compareTo() of Comparable interface.

    //Now, suppose we want sort movies by their rating and names also. When we make a collection element comparable(by having it implement Comparable),
    //we get only one chance to implement the compareTo() method. The solution is using Comparator.

    //Unlike Comparable, Comparator is external to the element type we are comparing. Itâ€™s a separate class.
    //We create multiple separate classes (that implement Comparator) to compare by different members.

    //Collections class has a second sort() method and it takes Comparator. The sort() method invokes the compare() to sort objects.
    //To compare movies by Rating, we need to do 3 things :
    //Create a class that implements Comparator (and thus the compare() method that does the work previously done by compareTo()).
    //Make an instance of the Comparator class.
    //Call the overloaded sort() method, giving it both the list and the instance of the class that implements Comparator.
    //To summarize, if sorting of objects needs to be based on natural order then use Comparable whereas if you sorting needs to be done on
    // attributes of different objects, then use Comparator in Java.
