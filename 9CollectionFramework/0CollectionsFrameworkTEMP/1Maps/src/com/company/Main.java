//Map is not a part of collection framework.It is a stand alone interface.
//It replaces the obsolete dictionaries abstract class .
//Mao works on the principle of keys and values pairs. Where key being the words and values being the definition of the words.
//So Java map cannot contain duplicate key, and each key can map to only a single value.
//see the image for map hierarchy in java.
//Now, maps like all the core collection interfaces are generic in nature. They take two types one for the key and other for value.
//It is possible to use raw maps but it is not a good idea in general.
